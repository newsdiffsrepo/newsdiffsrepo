Sub inventor: Kim Wall died in the submarine
Anton Nilsson

The Swedish journalist Kim Wall, 30, an accomplished reporter whose work has appeared in international publications including The New York Times and The Guardian, has been missing since August 10.

She was last seen departing the Copenhagen harbour aboard the submarine alongside the inventor Peter Madsen.

Colleagues of the journalist have told Expressen her friends waved her off around 7pm, August 10. The following morning the submarine was discovered as it was about to sink. Peter Madsen was rescued from the vessel and arrested by police.

In a press release on Monday morning, Danish police finally revealed Madsen's explanation of what happened aboard the submarine.

The investigation has been shrouded in secrecy, but now police are able to share what Madsen, a 46-year-old eccentric and rocket-obsessed inventor, has told investigators in hearings.

Madsen claims there was an accident aboard the sub that caused Kim Wall's death, police said.

After the incident Madsen dumped her body at sea, somewhere in the Køge Bay located between Copenhagen and the Swedish coast, he has told police.

The exact location of where Madsen dumped the journalist's body has not been revealed.

Later on Monday, police announced that a cyclist on the Amager island just outside Copenhagen had found a part of a female body floating in the water.

The identity of the body is not known and an autopsy is underway, police said. The results of an ongoing DNA analysis of the remains are expected on Wednesday, police said.

Madsen continues to be held in jail, suspected of causing Kim Wall's death. He denies the allegation.

The case of the missing journalist has been covered extensively in Swedish and Danish media, as well as by international news outlets.

Kim Wall is a journalist with an impressive CV, which includes bylines in the Times, Guardian, TIME, Vice, Foreign Policy, and Harper's Magazine.

Her friends and colleagues have described her as a driven and ambitious journalist who tends to seek out unusual stories.

– When I saw the story on the news I felt it was the kind of story Kim would do. I wasn't surprised it was she that had been on the submarine, said Ye Ming, a New York-based photographer who has been working with Kim Wall on a separate story in recent months.

A Scottish reporter who studied with Kim Wall at Columbia University's journalism school, Christopher Harress, said he has long been an admirer of her work.

– As a journalist she is just so filled with wanderlust. Her stories are always well thought out and written in the best interest of the people they're about.

– She is just such a lovely person who people always want to be around.

Mutual friends have told Mr. Harress that Kim Wall was planning to pitch the submarine story to the U.S. tech magazine Wired. She was doing preparatory reporting when she went missing.

Wired has told Expressen that Ms. Wall never worked for the magazine.

"The journalist has never written for Wired US and did not have an assignment from us", the magazine wrote in a statement to Expressen.

The Guardian wrote in a comment to Expressen:

"Kim Wall has contributed a number of pieces for the Guardian - we hope she is found safe and well".

Her family wrote in a statment:

"It is with great dismay we, her family, received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark. We believe and sincerely hope that she will be found in good health". The family added:

"Kim is intensely focused, ambitious and dedicated to her work. She writes extensively about social issues, foreign politics, pop culture and gender equality issues".

Madsen intially told the press, through a defence attorney, that he had something he wanted to explain about Kim Wall's disappearance.

But a Copenhagen judge ruled the court session be held behind closed doors, and Madsen was unable to make his revalation known – until now.

Madsen's initial explanation was that he dropped Kim Wall off at shore on Thursday evening, August 10, around 10.30pm, police have said.

However police later said his story had changed, but did not elaborate further at that time.

– In our first press statement we said he explained he left her at 10.30pm (on August 10) at Refshaleøe. Given that I'm now telling you that he has given conflicting explanations, it is correct that we have been given a different explanation, said Jens Møller, chief of the Copenhagen police homicide division shortly after Madsen was arrested.

Monday's revelation appears to account for the discrepancy.

After she went missing, investigators launched a massive search operation for Kim Wall, trying to locate her in the water using aircraft and marine vessels.

Police tip lines were flooded by calls from hundreds of witnesses, many of whom shared pictures of the submarine before its disappearance.

Expressen was able to publish the last known video footage of Kim Wall aboard the submarine, taken just hours before she was reported missing.

The submarine was retrieved from the sea several days after it sank.

Investigators were quickly able to determine that Madsen appeared to have sunken the vessel deliberately. Madsen has claimed the vessel went down because of a techinical problem.

The sub probe also led to a promising revelation: Kim Wall's body had not been found inside.

But any hope of finding the journalist alive were soon dashed, as investigators told reporters that the focus of the search had been shifted to finding a body.

That search continues as of Monday.



Danish and Swedish authorities said on Monday they have been able to map out the route where the submarine traveled – a trip through Danish waters in southern Öresund Bay and north-western Køge Bay.

On Friday, Danish officials were searching the water using divers and sonar equpiment.

Volunteers with the Swedish Sea Rescue Society told Expressen on Monday that their work contunes despite the new revelations.

– We have worked on a voluntary basis this entire time, and will likely continue doing that, said Lasse Larsson, an official with the SSRS.
